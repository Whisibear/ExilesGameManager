"""Central toggle for hiding IPs and folder paths from anything a super
admin exposes on-screen while Privacy Mode is on (Super Admin > Privacy
Mode) - lets them safely screen-share/stream without having to remember
every panel that might show a real IP or install path. Values are masked
at the API layer, before they ever reach the browser, the same way
app_log_reader.py already scrubs IPs from ExilesGameManager's own console log
for non-super-admins (see app/routes/logs.py) - Privacy Mode reuses that
same idea and widens when masking applies.

Only ever applied to passive, already-decided display values (an
instance's stored serverPath, a live network status field, a diagnostics
report). Interactive folder-picker flows (Deploy/Import/Save Import
dialogs) are deliberately left unmasked - the admin has to see the real
path there to confirm they picked the right folder, and masking it mid-
selection would make those dialogs unusable.
