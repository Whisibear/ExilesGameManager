"""Shared primitive for safely replacing a live directory's contents with
another directory's contents - used by both save_import_service.py (replacing
the active save slot with an imported world) and backup_service.py (restoring
a backup onto the live SaveGames folder).

The core problem this exists to avoid: the previous approach everywhere in
this codebase for "replace directory X with new content" was delete-then-copy
(see mod_installer.extract_and_install). For a live game server's save data,
that leaves X missing or half-copied for the entire duration of the copy if
the process is interrupted (crash, disk full, power loss) - there is no
window in which that's an acceptable risk for the only copy of someone's
world. safe_replace_dir() instead copies to a temporary sibling first,
verifies that copy, and only then swaps it into place with two fast renames -
the live directory is either left completely untouched or is fully replaced,
never left partially written. If the swap itself fails, the original (moved
aside, not deleted) is put straight back.
