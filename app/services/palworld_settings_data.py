"""Curated field metadata for the Server Settings editor.

Palworld's ~100 OptionSettings fields are read/written generically by
palworld_settings.py (type inferred from formatting, not hardcoded) - this
module only supplies the *labels/groups/help text/dropdown options* for the
fields worth curating, plus the small always-true data tables the generic
engine consults (which keys are managed by dedicated UI elsewhere, which
keys belong to the Local API group). Kept separate from the read/write logic
so the ~100-entry metadata table doesn't drown out the actual engine code.
