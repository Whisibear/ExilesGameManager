"""One-time provisioning from the installer's collected answers (just the
super admin account) - lets a fresh install finish setup automatically on
first launch instead of the user re-entering what they already gave the
installer.

The installer writes a plaintext seed file (install_dir()/first_run_seed.json)
with the collected answers. This applies them once, at startup, using the
exact same code path the UI itself would call, then deletes the seed file -
on both success and failure, since it holds a plaintext password and
shouldn't linger on disk regardless of how setup went.

Server creation deliberately isn't part of this (TICKET-0132): it used to
run as a fire-and-forget background SteamCMD deploy here, with no reliable
way for the app's own UI to know it had actually finished - the app now
forces the super admin to create their first server through its own
already-reliable Deploy/Import flow the first time they log in instead.
