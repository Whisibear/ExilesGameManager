"""Downloads and installs UE4SS (the mod loader most Palworld Lua/Logic mods
require, including PalSchema) straight from GitHub releases into
<server>/Pal/Binaries/Win64.

Uses Okaetsu/RE-UE4SS's "experimental-palworld" build rather than the
generic UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS stable release (TICKET-0142): as of Palworld patch
0.4.1.5, PalSchema and most current-generation mods require this
Palworld-specific fork, which also lays files out differently - dwmapi.dll
stays directly in Win64, but everything else (UE4SS.dll, settings, Mods/)
lives one level deeper under a Win64/ue4ss/ folder, not flat in Win64 like
the old stable release. Leftover files from the old flat layout actively
conflict with this one (the old UE4SS.dll loads instead, silently breaking
PalSchema and its dependent mods), so installing/updating also cleans up any
flat-layout files this tool previously placed, and migrates any mods that
had landed in the old Win64/Mods folder into the new Win64/ue4ss/Mods.

Installing merges into any existing ue4ss/Mods folder rather than replacing
it, so mods a user already installed through this tool (or by hand) survive
an install/update. Uninstalling only removes the exact set of paths this
tool placed there (recorded at install time), so it never touches unrelated
mods.
